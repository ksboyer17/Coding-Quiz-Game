# Coding-Quiz-Game

This project was generated using CSS, Javascript and HTML.

The project consist of three HTML files, two CSS files and three Javascript files. I seperated all of the pages to make it easier for other developers to decipher which page controls what portion of the project. This project was constructed in order to give me the opportunity to further understand Javascript and JQuery, while giving me additional practice with HTML and CSS.

**Game Functionality**
1. Users will arrive at the front page of the game where they will be presented with a play button and a highscores button. The play button will take them directly to the game while the highscores button will allow them to scope out the highscores before they take thier next shot at the game.

2. Once the game starts the user will be presented with the first of four questions. Click the answer to the question in order to advance to the next question. There are 4 questions total!

3. Four questions may not sound like a lot but users will be racing a 60 second clock that starts as soon as the page loads. If you answer a question wrong ten seconds will be removed off of the clock!

4. Once you have completed the quiz you will be redirected to the final html page where you will have the opportunity to submit your score. If your score is not in the top five, you will not show up on the leaderboard!
